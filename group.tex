\tag{category}

\begin{dfn*}
	A \emph{group} consists of a set $G$ together with a binary operation satisfying:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item (Associativity): For any $a,b,c\in G$, $(ab)c = a(bc)$.
		\item (Identity): There is an element $1_G\in G$ such that for any $a\in G$, $a1_G = a = 1_Ga$,
		\item (Inverses): For any $a\in G$, there is an element $a^{-1}\in G$ such that
		      $aa^{-1} = 1_G = a^{-1}a$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{dfn*}

Groups can be \zf[categorified]{category}; see \zf{groupoid}.

\begin{notation}
	The identity is also written $e_G$. Groups are sometimes written additively,
	in which case the identity is $0_G$ and inverses are $-a$.

	Some authors include closure as a fourth axiom; I prefer thinking of it as a
	restriction on the meaning of operation.
\end{notation}
