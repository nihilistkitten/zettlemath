\tag{category-theory}

In general, we want \zf[categories]{category} that are bigger than sets, since
we want to assemble entire kinds of algebraic structures into categories. That
motivates the following definition:

\begin{dfn*}[Small; Locally Small]
	A category is \emph{small} if its morphisms form a set. A category is
	\emph{locally small} if, for each pair of objects $X, Y$, the morphisms
	$\cC(X, Y)$ forms a set.
\end{dfn*}

Any small category is locally small, since the morphisms between two objects
form a subset of the set of morphisms. The objects in any small category form a
set, since they are in bijection with the identity morphisms, which form a
subset of the set of morphisms.
