\begin{dfn*}[Groupoid; Group]\label{cat:groupoid}
	A \emph{groupoid} is a \zf{category} in which all morphisms are
	\zf[isomorphisms]{isomorphism}. A \emph{group} is a monoidal groupoid, i.e., a
	groupoid with one object.
\end{dfn*}

This is indeed a definition. Any group can be represented as a monoid by taking
its automorphisms to be the group elements with composition given by
multiplication. This monoid is a groupoid, since group multiplication is
invertible. Further, given any monoidal groupoid, a group can be constructed by
taking its morphisms as elements and its composition as multiplication.

Groupoids are self-\zf[dual]{opposite-category}.
