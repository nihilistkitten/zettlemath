\tag{category-theory}
\tag{construction-on-category}

The opposite \zf{category} is intuitively constructed by "reversing the arrows"
of each of the arrows in an original category. Indeed, the syntax of category
theory admits this kind of dual construction:

\begin{dfn*}[Opposite Category]
	Fix a category $\cat{C}$. The \emph{opposite category} $\opc{C}$ consists of
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The same objects as in $\cat{C}$.
		\item For each morphism $f: X\rightarrow Y$ in $\cat{C}$, a morphism
		      $\op{f}: Y\rightarrow X$ in $\opc{C}$.
	\end{itemize}

	Identities and composition work in the "obvious" way, i.e. $\op{\id_X}$ is the
	identity of $X$ in $\opc{C}$, and
	$X\xrightarrow{\op{f}}Y\xrightarrow{\op{g}}Z$ compose to $\op{(fg)}:
		Z\rightarrow X$.
\end{dfn*}

This construction means that almost every theorem in category theory has a
\emph{dual theorem} obtainable by purely mechanically reversing all the arrows
in the proof.
